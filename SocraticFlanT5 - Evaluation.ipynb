    "This notebook evaluates the generated captions based on the MS COCO ground-truth captions. We will evaluate the folowing two approaches: \n",
    "1. <span style=\"color:#006400\">**Baseline**</span>: a Socratic model based on the work by [Zeng et al. (2022)](https://socraticmodels.github.io/) where GPT-3 is replaced by [FLAN-T5-xl](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/flan-t5). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. <span style=\"color:#006400\">**Improved prompting**</span>: an improved baseline model where the template prompt filled by CLIP is processed before passing to FLAN-T5-xl.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two approaches to this evaluation: rule-based and embedding-based.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "For the **rule-based approach**, the following metrics will be used, based on [this](https://github.com/salaniz/pycocoevalcap) repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *BLEU-4*: BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric that measures the similarity between the generated captions and the ground truth captions based on n-gram matching. The BLEU-4 score measures the precision of the generated captions up to four-grams compared to the ground truth captions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *METEOR*: METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering) is another metric that measures the similarity between the generated captions and the ground truth captions. It also takes into account word order and synonymy by using a set of reference summaries to compute a harmonic mean of precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *CIDEr*: CIDEr (Consensus-based Image Description Evaluation) is a metric that measures the consensus between the generated captions and the ground truth captions. It computes the similarity between the generated captions and the reference captions based on their TF-IDF weights, which helps capture important words in the captions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *SPICE*: SPICE (Semantic Propositional Image Caption Evaluation) is a metric that measures the semantic similarity between the generated captions and the ground truth captions. It analyzes the similarity between the semantic propositions present in the generated captions and those in the reference captions, taking into account the structure and meaning of the propositions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *ROUGE-L*: ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a metric that measures the similarity between the generated captions and the ground truth captions based on overlapping sequences of words. ROUGE-L measures the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the generated captions and the reference captions, taking into account sentence-level structure and word order.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "For the **embedding-based** approach (based on CLIP embeddings), we calculate the cosine similarities between each image embedding and embeddings of the ground truth captions and then we calculate the cosine similarities between each image embedding and embeddings of the captions generated with FLAN-T5-xl.\n",
